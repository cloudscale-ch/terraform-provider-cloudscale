  name         = "privnet"
}

# Add a server with two interfaces:
#  - one attached to the public network
#  - one attached to the private network "privnet"
resource "cloudscale_server" "gw" {
  name                = "gateway"
  zone_slug           = "lpg1"
  flavor_slug         = "flex-8-4"
  image_slug          = "debian-11"
  volume_size_gb      = 20
  ssh_keys            = ["ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIL2jzgla23DfRVLQr3KT20QQYovqCCN3clHrjm2ZuQFW user@example.com"]
